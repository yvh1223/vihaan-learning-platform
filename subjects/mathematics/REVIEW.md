# Mathematics Content Review

## Current strengths
- The subject index page offers a visually rich hero, animated chapter cards, and an embedded practice assessment call-to-action that orients students to the big picture of the 5th-grade math path.
- Chapter 1 (Numbers & Operations) already uses manipulatives, step-by-step examples, and quick-check challenges, which helps students see computations in context.

## Opportunities for deeper learning support
- Learners need more scaffolding about why each resource matters; explicit _learning goals_, _vocabulary_, and _reflection prompts_ make self-regulated study easier.
- The subject overview can guide learning habits (e.g., preview-practice-review loop, pacing tips) so students know how to work through the chapters intentionally.
- Transition cues between chapters should highlight the progression of skills and link to next steps instead of relying solely on navigation buttons.

## Improvements implemented
1. Added a learning guidance panel to `index.html` that spells out the learning path, study strategy, and how to pair practice with reflection.
2. Embedded a “Focus & Vocabulary” callout, practice prompts, and reflection checklist at the start and end of `chapter-1.html` so learners know what to expect and how to review effectively.
3. Documented this review so future editors can build on the same learning-first mindset.
