# Security Requirements & Configuration Guide

## GitHub Secrets Configuration

The following secrets must be configured in the GitHub repository settings:

### Required Secrets for Production Deployment

#### Supabase Configuration
```
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9...
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9...
```

#### OpenAI Configuration (for AI Remediation)
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...
OPENAI_ORG_ID=org-...
```

#### Optional Integrations
```
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/...
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_... (if additional GitHub API access needed)
```

## Environment Variable Injection Strategy

### Development Environment
- Uses placeholder values in `config/public-config.json`
- Real credentials stored in `.env.local` (git-ignored)
- Local development server loads from environment

### Production Environment  
- GitHub Actions workflow replaces placeholders with secrets
- Environment variables injected during build process
- No sensitive data committed to repository

## Security Implementation Checklist

### ✅ Data Protection
- [ ] Row Level Security (RLS) enabled in Supabase
- [ ] Anonymous authentication for student progress
- [ ] Student data encrypted at rest
- [ ] No PII stored in local storage
- [ ] Session tokens expire after 1 hour

### ✅ Code Security
- [ ] No hardcoded API keys in source code
- [ ] Sensitive files excluded via `.gitignore`
- [ ] Content Security Policy headers configured
- [ ] HTTPS enforced for all connections
- [ ] Input validation on all form submissions

### ✅ Access Control
- [ ] Public anon key for read/write student progress
- [ ] Service role key restricted to GitHub Actions only
- [ ] Admin functions require elevated permissions
- [ ] Rate limiting on API endpoints
- [ ] User session management implemented

### ✅ Privacy Compliance
- [ ] Anonymous student tracking (no personal identifiers)
- [ ] Data retention policy implemented (local only)
- [ ] Clear privacy policy displayed
- [ ] Parental consent mechanisms for data usage
- [ ] Right to data deletion implemented

## Deployment Security Configuration

### GitHub Actions Security
```yaml
# Restricted permissions
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

# Secure secret access
environment:
  name: production
  url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
```

### Content Security Policy
```javascript
// Implemented in production deployment
"Content-Security-Policy": "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data: https:; connect-src 'self' https://*.supabase.co https://api.openai.com;"
```

### Service Worker Security
- Only caches trusted resources
- Validates all network requests
- Secure background sync for offline data
- No sensitive data cached locally

## Monitoring & Alerts

### Security Monitoring
- Failed authentication attempts logged
- Unusual API usage patterns detected
- Unauthorized access attempts blocked
- Regular security audit reports generated

### Automated Security Checks
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Code security analysis in CI/CD
- Secrets detection in pull requests
- Regular security updates automated

## Incident Response Plan

### Security Breach Response
1. **Immediate**: Disable affected credentials
2. **Assessment**: Determine scope of potential data exposure
3. **Communication**: Notify users and stakeholders
4. **Remediation**: Apply security patches and updates
5. **Review**: Conduct post-incident analysis

### Credential Compromise
1. **Rotate**: Generate new API keys immediately
2. **Update**: Deploy with new credentials
3. **Monitor**: Watch for unauthorized usage
4. **Document**: Record incident for future prevention

## Compliance Requirements

### Educational Data Privacy
- COPPA compliance for users under 13
- FERPA compliance for educational records
- State privacy laws compliance (Texas)
- Clear data handling policies

### Technical Standards
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Performance optimization standards

## Regular Security Maintenance

### Monthly Tasks
- [ ] Review and rotate API keys
- [ ] Update security dependencies  
- [ ] Audit user access patterns
- [ ] Test incident response procedures

### Quarterly Tasks
- [ ] Comprehensive security audit
- [ ] Penetration testing
- [ ] Privacy policy review
- [ ] Security training updates

### Annual Tasks
- [ ] Full security assessment
- [ ] Compliance certification renewal
- [ ] Disaster recovery testing
- [ ] Security policy review
