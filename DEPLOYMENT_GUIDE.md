# 🚀 GitHub Actions Deployment Setup Guide

## ⚠️ OAuth Token Issue

The current OAuth token doesn't have `workflow` scope, which is required to create GitHub Actions workflows. Here's how to set up automated deployment and monitoring:

## 🔧 Manual Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to your repository settings: https://github.com/yvh1223/vihaan-learning-platform/settings
2. Scroll to "Pages" section
3. Select source: "Deploy from a branch"
4. Choose branch: `master` 
5. Folder: `/ (root)`
6. Click "Save"

### Step 2: Add GitHub Actions Workflows

**Option A: Direct File Creation**
1. Go to https://github.com/yvh1223/vihaan-learning-platform/actions/new
2. Click "set up a workflow yourself"
3. Copy the content from `.github/workflows/deploy-and-test.yml` (created locally)
4. Commit the workflow file

**Option B: Upload via GitHub Web Interface**
1. Navigate to your repository on GitHub
2. Create folder: `.github/workflows/`
3. Upload the following files from your local directory:
   - `.github/workflows/deploy-and-test.yml`
   - `.github/workflows/health-check.yml`
   - `.github/workflows/README.md`
