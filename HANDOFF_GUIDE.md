# 🔄 LLM/Developer Handoff Guide

**Quick Start for Any LLM or Developer Taking Over This Project**

## ⚡ IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

```
CURRENT STATUS: Epic 1 Complete ✅ → Epic 2 Ready to Start
NEXT TASK: Task 2.1 - Main Navigation System  
LOCATION: TASKS.md (line ~125)
TIME ESTIMATE: 8 hours
PRIORITY: HIGH (blocks all subject development)
```

## 🎯 30-Second Project Brief

**What**: Interactive learning platform for 5th graders  
**Who**: Vihaan (primary user) + multi-student support  
**Goal**: Visual learning + AI remediation + STAAR/MAP prep  
**Tech**: HTML/CSS/JS + Supabase + GPT-4o-mini  
**Status**: Foundation complete, need navigation system next  

## 📋 Essential Files to Read (in order)

1. **`PROJECT_STATUS.md`** ← START HERE (2 min read)
2. **`TASKS.md`** (sections: Status Guide + Epic 2) ← NEXT TASK DETAILS  
3. **`PRD.md`** (complete requirements) ← FULL CONTEXT
4. **`css/main.css`** (design system) ← EXISTING PATTERNS
5. **`VISUAL_CONTENT_PIPELINE.md`** (1000+ images strategy)

## 🚀 How to Continue Development

### Option 1: Claude Code / LLM Takeover
```
1. Read PROJECT_STATUS.md (understand current state)
2. Go to TASKS.md → Epic 2 → Task 2.1 
3. Review acceptance criteria for Main Navigation System
4. Follow existing patterns from css/main.css
5. Implement navigation following mobile-first approach
6. Update TASKS.md with ✅ completion markers
7. Move to Task 2.2 (Dashboard Statistics)
```

### Option 2: Human Developer Takeover  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yvh1223/vihaan-learning-platform.git
cd vihaan-learning-platform
npm install
npm run dev  # Opens localhost:3000

# Review current implementation
# Read TASKS.md for Task 2.1 requirements
# Implement navigation system
# Test on mobile/tablet/desktop
# Run npm run security-check before commit
```

## 🎨 Design System Quick Reference

- `.nav-link` - Navigation items
- `.stat-card` - Dashboard statistics

## 🏗️ Current Architecture

### File Structure
```
├── index.html (main dashboard)
├── css/ (design system)
├── js/ (app logic + service worker)
├── subjects/ (individual subject content) ← TO BE BUILT
├── assets/ (images, icons, multimedia) ← TO BE POPULATED  
├── config/ (public config + security)
├── scripts/ (build tools)
└── docs/ (documentation)
```

### Key Components Built
- ✅ Responsive design system with CSS variables
- ✅ PWA configuration with offline support
- ✅ Security configuration with automated scanning
- ✅ GitHub Actions deployment workflow
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation

### Components Needed Next
- 🔲 Main navigation system (Task 2.1) ← **NEXT**
- 🔲 Dashboard statistics display
- 🔲 Progress visualization
- 🔲 User preferences management
- 🔲 Mobile navigation optimization

## ⚠️ Critical Implementation Notes

### Security Requirements
- Never commit API keys (use GitHub Secrets)
- Run `npm run security-check` before any commit
- All sensitive files excluded via .gitignore
- Use placeholder values in development config

### Quality Standards  
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
- <3s load time on 3G networks
- Touch-friendly 44px+ buttons for mobile
- Child-friendly design (10-11 year olds)

### Cost Optimization
- Use GPT-4o-mini ($0.0003/1K tokens vs $0.03 GPT-4)
- Trigger AI only for wrong answers (not all questions)
- WebP images with lazy loading
- Progressive enhancement approach

## 🎯 Success Criteria for Next Task (2.1)

**Main Navigation System Requirements:**
- [ ] Responsive hamburger menu for mobile
- [ ] Subject icons with clear labels  
- [ ] Active state indicators
- [ ] Keyboard navigation support
- [ ] Screen reader accessibility
- [ ] Smooth animations/transitions
- [ ] Integration with existing design system

**Files to Create/Modify:**
- Update `index.html` navigation structure
- Enhance `js/app.js` with navigation logic
- Add navigation styles to `css/main.css`
- Test responsive behavior in `css/responsive.css`

## 📞 Getting Help

### Documentation Priority
1. **`TASKS.md`** - Detailed task breakdown
2. **`PRD.md`** - Complete project requirements  
3. **`VISUAL_CONTENT_PIPELINE.md`** - Image strategy
4. **`config/security-requirements.md`** - Security guide

### Key Principles
- **Mobile-first**: Design for phones, enhance for tablets/desktop
- **Visual learning**: Every concept needs supporting visuals
- **Accessibility**: Screen readers, keyboard nav, high contrast
- **Performance**: Optimize for slow connections and older devices
